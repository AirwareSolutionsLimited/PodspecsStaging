# Module Airware Services Library

The Airware Services Libraries connect a passenger with Airport and Airline services.

The services assist a passenger during check-in and travel, providing real-time updates for bag drop location, boarding gate, queue times and baggage collection points.

Location services provide proximity alerts when a passenger is in a baggage processing area.

Infrastructure services provide access to Bag Tag Printing, Boarding Pass Printing, and Weigh Scale appliances.

Identity services provide identity and online visa checks.
