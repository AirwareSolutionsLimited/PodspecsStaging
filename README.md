# Module Airware Services Library

The Airware Services Libraries connect a passenger with Airport and Airline services.

The services assist a passenger during check-in and travel, providing real-time updates for bag drop location, boarding gate, queue times and baggage collection points.

Information services provide boarding gate, security queue time, and baggage collection point for the passenger flight.

Location services provide proximity alerts when a passenger is in a baggage processing area.

Infrastructure services provide access to Bag Tag Printing, Boarding Pass Printing, and Weigh Scale appliances.

Identity services provide identity and online visa checks.
